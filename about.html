                <p>Thinkers GK (合同会社 Thinkers) is a premium IT services company based in Tokyo, Japan. We specialize in providing bilingual IT support, field engineering, cybersecurity, and IT asset lifecycle management to businesses operating in Japan.</p>

                <p>We started Thinkers GK because we saw a gap in the market: companies in Japan — especially foreign businesses — needed IT support that understood both the technical and cultural landscape. Too many providers were either technically capable but communication-challenged, or great communicators with shallow technical depth.</p>

                <p>We built a team that does both.</p>

                <h3>What sets us apart</h3>
                <p>Our team operates natively in both English and Japanese. This isn't just about language — it's about understanding how business is done in Japan. We know how to navigate vendor relationships, comply with local regulations, and deliver the kind of reliable, thorough service that Japanese business culture expects.</p>

                <p>We're also vendor-agnostic. We recommend what's best for your business, not what earns us the biggest commission. Whether that's AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or a hybrid approach — our advice is always based on your specific needs.</p>

                <h3>Our approach</h3>
                <p>We believe in proactive IT. Rather than waiting for things to break, we monitor, maintain, and optimize your infrastructure continuously. When issues do arise, our response is fast, thorough, and documented so it doesn't happen again.</p>

                <p>Every client gets a dedicated point of contact — no call centers, no ticket queues, no explaining your setup to a different person every time. We learn your systems and become an extension of your team.</p>

                <h3>Compliance & security</h3>
                <p>Security isn't an add-on; it's built into everything we do. Our processes are aligned with ISO 27001, and our data destruction services comply with NIST 800-88 guidelines. We provide full audit trails and certificates of destruction for every asset we handle.</p>
